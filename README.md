# 🤖 Robo Sumo Bot

A **Robo Sumo Bot** built using **Arduino Uno**, **L298N Motor Driver**, and an **Ultrasonic Sensor**.  
The bot is designed to detect an opponent within **50 cm** and push it outside the ring.  
If no opponent is detected, the bot **rotates right and moves forward slightly** before scanning again — repeating the process.

## 🛠️ Working Principle
1. **Ultrasonic sensor** continuously measures distance.  
2. If opponent is detected within **50 cm → Bot drives forward** at full speed to push it out.  
3. If no opponent is detected → Bot **rotates right slightly and moves forward ~5cm**, then scans again.  
4. This loop continues until the opponent is pushed outside the boundary.  

---

## 📜 Procedure to Implement
1. Assemble the chassis and mount **DC motors**.  
2. Connect motors to the **L298N motor driver**.  
3. Connect the **L298N** to **Arduino Uno** (as per pin connections).  
4. Wire the **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor** to detect opponents.  
5. Upload the Arduino code (`RoboSumo.ino`) provided in this repository.  
6. Power the bot using a **battery pack (6V–12V)**.  
7. Place the bot inside the ring → it will automatically start scanning and pushing the opponent.  

---

## ⚠️ Precautions
1. Do not power the **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)** with more than **5V**.  
2. Ensure **common ground** between Arduino, L298N, and battery.  
3. Use a **battery holder** to prevent loose connections.  
4. Motors can draw high current → never power motors directly from Arduino 5V.  
5. If motors don’t spin → check **L298N jumpers** and wiring.
